				<h1>About Need No Name.</h1>

				<hr>

			<p>This site is a testbed for a nerd calling himself "luiges90", who just write random code. You can find many of his productions here.</p>
			
			<p>Currently, there are some games that runs directly on any modern browsers here. And we know, more are coming in, and could possibly outside this realm too.</p>
			
			<p>If you find this site sucks, it is normal, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law">90% of everything is crap</a>. Success is the special case, failure is the norm. So, he does not expect any good from this site really.</p>
			
			<p>However, we are come to learn. The Never-ending Technology, and The Never-ending Science.</p>
			
			<p>If you <i>do</i> find this site good, look around and spread the word. If you know how to code, maybe go to his <a href="https://github.com/luiges90">github</a> and look around there too.</p>
